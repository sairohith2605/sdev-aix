## Why Token Efficiency Matters

### Impact on AI Performance

- **Context limits:** GPT-4 has 128k token context, Claude 200k
- **Cost:** Each token costs money in API calls
- **Speed:** Fewer tokens = faster processing
- **Comprehension:** Concise content is easier to parse

### Target Metrics

| Skill Type | SKILL.md Target | With References    |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Simple     | 150-300 lines   | N/A                |
| Medium     | 300-400 lines   | +200-300/reference |
| Complex    | 400 lines max   | +200-500/reference |

**Golden rule:** SKILL.md should never exceed 400 lines for complex skills (move details to references).

---

## Frontmatter Optimization

### Omit Empty Fields

```yaml
# ❌ WASTES 3 LINES (42 tokens)
name: prettier
description: Prettier code formatting. Trigger: When configuring Prettier.
skills: []
dependencies: {}
allowed-tools: []

# ✅ SAVES 3 LINES (28 tokens, 33% reduction)
name: prettier
description: Prettier code formatting. Trigger: When configuring Prettier.
```

**Savings:** 14 tokens per skill × 30 skills = **420 tokens saved**

### Description Precision

```yaml
# ❌ WORDY (142 characters, ~35 tokens)
description: This skill provides guidance and best practices for creating and maintaining skills in the project using conventions and standards. Trigger: When creating skills.

# ✅ CONCISE (89 characters, ~22 tokens, 37% reduction)
description: Guide for creating standards-compliant skills with templates and validation. Trigger: When creating a new skill.
```

**Technique:** Remove filler words

### Input/Output Specificity

```yaml
# ❌ OBVIOUS (adds no value, wastes tokens)
input: "User request | string"
output: "Response | string"

# ✅ OMIT (obvious from description)
# (no input/output fields)

# ✅ INCLUDE WHEN SPECIFIC
input: "Skill name, patterns list, complexity level | string, array, enum"
output: "Validated SKILL.md file with frontmatter | markdown"
```

**Rule:** Include input/output ONLY when they add specificity beyond description.

---

## Content Compression

### Eliminate Filler Phrases

| Filler Phrase                  | Replacement | Savings     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| "In order to"                  | "To"        | 3 words → 1 |
| "It is important to note that" | "Note:"     | 6 words → 1 |
| "You should make sure to"      | "Ensure"    | 5 words → 1 |
| "In most cases"                | "Usually"   | 3 words → 1 |
| "As a result of"               | "Because"   | 4 words → 1 |

**Example:**

```markdown
# ❌ FILLER (32 words)

In order to effectively manage state in your React components, it is important to note that you should make sure to use the useState hook in most cases.

# ✅ DIRECT (11 words, 66% reduction)

Use useState hook for component state management in React.
```

### Unify Redundant Points

```markdown
# ❌ REDUNDANT (3 bullets, 15 words)

- Use clear naming conventions
- Keep names short and readable
- Choose descriptive identifiers

# ✅ UNIFIED (1 bullet, 7 words, 53% reduction)

- Use clear, concise, descriptive names
```

### Remove Introductory Statements

```markdown
# ❌ WASTES 2 LINES

This section provides comprehensive information about critical patterns.

### Critical Patterns

# ✅ DIRECT (save 1 line + tokens)

### Critical Patterns
```

**Rule:** Section headings are self-explanatory; skip introductions.

---

## Code Example Optimization

### Plain Text Code Blocks: Use ``` Not ```text

Omit the `text` language hint — it adds tokens with no rendering benefit.

```
# ❌ WRONG: unnecessary hint
```text
condition? → action
Otherwise → fallback
```

# ✅ CORRECT: no hint for plain text

```
condition? → action
Otherwise → fallback
```

```

**Rule:** Only use language hints (`typescript`, `bash`, `json`, etc.) when syntax highlighting adds value.

---

### Keep Examples Focused

```typescript
// ❌ BLOATED (25 lines with imports, types, full component)
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import type { User } from './types';

interface Props {
  userId: string;
}

export function UserProfile({ userId }: Props) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchUser() {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      setUser(data);
    }
    fetchUser();
  }, [userId]);

  if (!user) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}

// ✅ FOCUSED (6 lines, shows only the pattern)
useEffect(() => {
  async function fetchUser() {
    const data = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`).then(r => r.json());
    setUser(data);
  }
  fetchUser();
}, [userId]);
```

**Technique:** Remove imports, types, UI code - show only the relevant pattern.

### Use Comments for Explanation

```typescript
// ❌ VERBOSE EXPLANATION (4 lines of text + 3 lines of code)
When using useEffect for data fetching, you must include all dependencies
in the dependency array. In this case, userId is used inside the effect,
so it must be in the array. Failing to do so will cause stale closures.

useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId);
}, [userId]);

// ✅ INLINE COMMENT (3 lines total, 43% reduction)
// Include all dependencies to prevent stale closures
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId);
}, [userId]);
```

### Comparison Pattern

```typescript
// ✅ EFFICIENT: Show correct and wrong in same block
// ✅ CORRECT: All dependencies included
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId);
}, [userId]);

// ❌ WRONG: Missing dependency causes stale closure
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId);
}, []);
```

**Benefit:** Single code block, inline explanation, visual contrast.

## Section Organization

### Combine Related Content

````markdown
# ❌ SEPARATED (multiple small sections)

## Installation

```bash
npm install prettier
```
````

---

## Configuration

```json
{
  "semi": true
}
```

---

## Usage

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

# ✅ COMBINED (single cohesive section)

---

## Setup and Usage

```bash
# Install
npm install prettier

# Configure (.prettierrc)
{
  "semi": true
}

# Format
npx prettier --write .
```

````

**Savings:** 3 headings → 1, fewer transitions, more coherent flow.

### Use Tables for Comparison

```markdown
# ❌ VERBOSE (8 lines)
For simple skills with fewer than 15 patterns, use SKILL.md only.
For medium skills with 15-40 patterns, use SKILL.md plus assets directory.
For complex skills with more than 40 patterns, use SKILL.md plus assets and references directories.

# ✅ TABLE (5 lines, includes more information)
| Complexity | Patterns | Structure |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Simple     | <15      | SKILL.md only |
| Medium     | 15-40    | SKILL.md + assets/ |
| Complex    | 40+      | SKILL.md + assets/ + references/ |
````

**Benefit:** More information in less space, easier to scan.

---

## Decision Tree Efficiency

### Compact Format

```markdown
# ❌ VERBOSE (10 lines)

If the file is a TypeScript file, then use strict typing.
If the file is a JavaScript file, then use JSDoc comments.
If the file type is neither, then skip typing.

If you need state management, use useState hook.
If you need side effects, use useEffect hook.
Otherwise, use a pure function component.

# ✅ COMPACT (6 lines, 40% reduction)
```

TypeScript file? → Use strict typing
JavaScript file? → Use JSDoc comments
Otherwise → Skip typing

Needs state? → useState hook
Needs effects? → useEffect hook
Otherwise → Pure function

```

```

---

## Reference Links Efficiency

### Inline References

```markdown
# ❌ VERBOSE (7 lines)

For more information about hooks, see the hooks reference.
For more information about components, see the components reference.
For more information about performance, see the performance reference.

Links:

- [Hooks](references/hooks.md)
- [Components](references/components.md)
- [Performance](references/performance.md)

# ✅ INLINE (3 lines, 57% reduction)

See [hooks](references/hooks.md) for state patterns,
[components](references/components.md) for composition,
[performance](references/performance.md) for optimization.
```

### Contextual Links

```markdown
# ✅ EFFICIENT: Link where pattern is mentioned

### ✅ REQUIRED: Custom Hooks

{Brief inline example}

See [hooks.md](references/hooks.md) for advanced patterns.
```

**Benefit:** User gets reference exactly when they need it.

---

## Writing Techniques

### Active Voice

```markdown
# ❌ PASSIVE (wordy)

State should be updated using the setState function.

# ✅ ACTIVE (concise)

Update state using setState.
```

### Imperative Mood

```markdown
# ❌ SUGGESTIVE

You should use TypeScript for type safety.

# ✅ IMPERATIVE

Use TypeScript for type safety.
```

### Direct Address (sparingly)

```markdown
# ❌ INDIRECT

When creating a skill, developers need to ensure...

# ✅ DIRECT

Ensure your skill includes...
```

### Eliminate Hedging

```markdown
# ❌ HEDGING (uncertainty)

It might be a good idea to consider using...

# ✅ CONFIDENT (direct)

Use...
```
